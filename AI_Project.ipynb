            "**Missing Skills:**  While the resume lists Cloud Computing, DevOps, and related tools (AWS, Docker, Git) under skills, practical project experience demonstrating these skills seems to be lacking based on the project descriptions provided.  The job description doesn't specify *which* cloud computing skills are required, so further clarification may be needed.  Additionally, experience with specific MLOps tools and practices (e.g., model deployment, monitoring) would strengthen the application.  Finally, no experience with Big Data technologies (Spark, Hadoop, etc.) is mentioned, which is often required for MLE roles.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Weak Skills:**  The resume claims proficiency in several areas (AI/ML, Web Development), but project descriptions primarily showcase Python and basic ML/DL applications. Deeper experience with more advanced ML concepts (e.g., different model architectures, hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, model evaluation metrics beyond accuracy) would be beneficial.  Similarly, listing web development skills without related projects makes it hard to assess actual proficiency.\n",

For example, in the Resume Analyzer project, mention \"Improved resume screening efficiency by X%,\" or in the Stock Prediction project, explain how the 89% accuracy compares to a baseline model or industry benchmark.  Add details about the size and complexity of the datasets used.\n",
            "* **Expand Project Descriptions:**  Provide more context for each project. What was the problem being solved? What approach was taken? What were the key challenges and learnings?  Were these individual projects or team efforts?  If team projects, what was the candidate's specific role and contribution?\n",
            "* **Showcase MLOps Experience (if any):**  If the candidate has any experience with deploying, monitoring, or maintaining machine learning models, this should be highlighted prominently, ideally within the project descriptions.\n",
            "* **Highlight Relevant Coursework:** While the core courses are listed, mentioning specific relevant coursework related to machine learning algorithms, statistics, and data analysis (beyond just listing them as \"core courses\") would be helpful.  For example, \"Achieved A+ in Advanced Machine Learning, covering topics X, Y, and Z.\"\n",
            "* **Tailor to the Job Description:**  Carefully review the job description and ensure that the resume highlights the most relevant skills and experiences. If the job description emphasizes specific tools or techniques, ensure those are prominently featured.\n",
            "* **Improve Formatting and Clarity:** While this resume is reasonably formatted, consistency is key.  Use consistent formatting for dates, bullet points, and headings.  Consider using a more visually appealing and ATS-friendly template.  The repetition of \"Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai\" is redundant. The Linkedin profile should be a proper URL.  Combine the two entries for the IIT Madras Diploma.  The certifications are already in a dedicated section, so the \"Improvement Suggestions\" provided in the job description on this point are incorrect based on the resume provided.\n",
            "* **Consider a Summary/Objective Statement:** A brief summary at the beginning of the resume highlighting key skills and career aspirations can help grab the recruiter's attention.\n",
